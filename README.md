# AliasSampling

In graph based random walks, sampling of neighbors can be done in many ways. But all of them are not equally efficient.

Alias Sampling is a method to perform this in O(1) time. While some initial cost is incurred in setting up the data structures, for a even moderate number of samples - it leads to gain in efficiency.
